/**
 * This class provides a HashMap-backed implementation of the 
 * Set interface.
 *
 * Each element in the Set is a key in the backing HashMap; each key
 * maps to a static token, denoting that the key does, in fact, exist.
 *
 * Most operations are O(1), assuming no hash collisions.  In the worst
 * case (where all hases collide), operations are O(n).
 *
 * HashSet is a part of the JDK1.2 Collections API.
