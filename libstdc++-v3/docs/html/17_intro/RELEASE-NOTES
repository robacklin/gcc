Release Notes   
-------------
The Standard C++ Library v3, or libstdc++-2.9x, is an ongoing
project to implement the ISO 14882 Standard C++ library as described
in chapters 17 through 27 and annex D, as a drop-in replacement
for the current (ARM-conformant) library.

This is the eleventh snapshot of the libstdc++ rewrite.  It is still
incomplet and incorrekt. It's a lot less incomplete and incorrect than
some of the earlier snapshots though, and quite usable.

The Standard C++ Library v3, or libstdc++-2.9x, follows an open
development model, attempting to be fully buzzword, bazaar, and GNU
compliant. Full details on participating, including contributor
guidelines, mailing list subscription, mailing list archives,
up-to-date documentation, and various and sundry other details can be
found at the following URL:

  http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/


New: 
--- 
- preliminary doxygen documentation has been added. Running "make
  doxygen" in the libstdc++-v3 build directory will generate HTML
  documentation that can be used to cross-reference names and files in
  the library.
- a dejagnu based testing framework has been added
- a new implementation of the concept checking code has been ported
  from the boost libraries.
- support for -fno-exceptions has been added
- stdexcept was re-written
- using deprecated or antiquated headers now gives a warning
- the stdio interface to iostreams has been tweaked, and now works
  with synchronized c/c++ io
- new libsupc++ routines implementing the IA-64 C++ ABI.
- HPUX configuration files
- support for AIX added
- a lot of bugs were fixed.
- preliminary named locales implemented
- portability improvements made to generation of <limits>
- speedups to improve configuration time.
- DJGPP support added.
- support for dlopening shared libstdc++

What doesn't:

Contact:
--------
Places have changed from previous snapshots.  The web page, which has
information about joining the mailing list and searching its archives,
CVS access, and contribution information is now at:

  http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/

Please note that the mailing list has recently moved, and is now
hosted on gcc.gnu.org. (The web site above has the most
up-to-date info.)
   
Obtain the library snapshot via ftp (including these release notes) from

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/libstdc++/

The library is maintained by Benjamin Kosnik, Gabriel
Dos Reis, Phil Edwards, and Ulrich Drepper.  


Development tools:
------------------

You will need a recent version of gcc to compile the snapshot of
libstdc++. The use of CVS gcc, or gcc-3_0-branch is strongly
recommended, which may introduce additional dependencies for
up-to-date binutils. In addition, you may need up-to-date tools for
modifying Makefiles and regenerating configure scripts: automake
(version 1.4), autoconf (version 2.13 and higher), and libtool.
